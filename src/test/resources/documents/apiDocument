In order to get a more in depth idea of your technical skills, we would like to continue the process with a case.
Please let me know when you think you could be done with the assignment.
Details:
This exercise aims at getting an automated test solution for some scenarios using the open API https://gorest.co.in/
Please, refer to the corresponding documentation whenever required.
Testing objectives:
1.   Create a new user in the system. Make the corresponding assertions to confirm the data persists.
2.   Rename the user and check it was correctly updated in the system.
3.   Create a post with 1 comment as the above user. Check the comment persists and is related with the correct user.
4.   Now delete the user. Confirm the previously generated data is no longer accessible.
Some additional notes:
· Even though we recommend to use Serenity framework, it's up to the candidate to go for any other alternative.
· Complete the assignment as you would write production code.
· Use of Gherkin language to define the use cases would be a plus.
· Solution can be returned in a GitHub/Bitbucket repository or zip
